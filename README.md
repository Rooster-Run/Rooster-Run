<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project:

Rooster Run has been developed and maintained by 9 Computer Science undergraduate students at Aston University. Rooster Run offers a fun and interactive multiplayer which is aimed at audiences aged 7-15 years. The game offers bright colours and blocky text to entice its audiences, with the built-in multiplayer player mode offering you the ability to play with your family and friends.

The Rooster Run storyline comes from the idea of Roosters planning their escape from a Barn or a Slaughterhouse, the Roosters must compete against each other to escape, the Airplane at the end of the map only offers one seat so the first rooster to get there wins freedom and the others will be Sunday roast.

Rooster Run offers powerups such as lighting to increase speed and power-downs such as mud to slow the player down. The game also allows the collection of coins that can save your life as you run across the map. Rooster run will be available to our players on the 1st April 2021 with the ability to create lobbies and share them with your friends to join and compete against each other.

Rooster Run makes use of the java language with libraries such as LibGDX and Kryonet being used in the development of the game and networking. GitHub has also been used extensively during the development process to offer a workspace that allows developers to collaborate on coding projects in addition to maintaining versioning control.

## Built With:

### Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/

Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications.

### LibGDX: https://libgdx.com/

libGDX is a cross-platform Java game development framework based on OpenGL (ES) that works on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, your browser and iOS. libGDX provides a well-tried and robust environment for rapid prototyping and fast iterations. libGDX does not force a specific design or coding style on you; it rather gives you the freedom to create a game the way you prefer.

### Kryonet: https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet

KryoNet is a Java library that provides a clean and simple API for efficient TCP and UDP client/server network communication using NIO. KryoNet uses the Kryo serialization library to transfer object graphs automatically and efficiently across the network. KryoNet runs on both the desktop and on Android.

### Google Cloud: https://cloud.google.com/

Google Cloud Platform is a provider of computing resources for deploying and operating applications on the web. Its specialty is providing a place for individuals and enterprises to build and run software, and it uses the web to connect to the users of that software.

### GitHub: https://github.com/

GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
